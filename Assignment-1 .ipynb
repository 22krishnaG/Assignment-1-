The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus, many programmers believe that it is an interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system)."

    "#### Ans: The maximum possible length of an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.) in Python is technically unlimited. However, for readability purposes, it is recommended to keep the length of identifiers reasonable and descriptive. According to the Python style guide (PEP 8), variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores, and function names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores, or use mixedCase if preferred. It is also recommended to avoid using single-character variable names, except for cases like indexing (i, j, k), and to avoid using reserved keywords as variable names."

    "### Q.14 How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "#### Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, using a combination of reference counting and a garbage collector.\n",
    "#### Reference counting is a simple and efficient memory management technique that keeps track of the number of references to an object. When the number of references to an object becomes zero, the object is deleted from memory. This mechanism ensures that memory is freed as soon as an object is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, reference counting alone is not sufficient to manage all memory in Python, especially in the case of circular references, where two or more objects refer to each other, and their reference count never reaches zero. To handle these cases, Python uses a garbage collector, which periodically scans the memory to detect and remove circular references and other objects that are no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's garbage collector is based on the concept of generations, which means that objects are divided into different generations based on their age. New objects are created in the youngest generation (generation 0), and as they survive and become older, they are moved to older generations (generation 1, 2, and so on). The garbage collector is more aggressive in cleaning up younger generations, which tend to contain more short-lived objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall, Python's memory management system is designed to be efficient and automatic, so that developers can focus on writing code without worrying about memory allocation and deallocation. However, it's still important for developers to be aware of memory usage and to avoid creating unnecessary objects or circular references that could lead to memory leaks or performance issues."

To do this you have to go \"Advance System settings\" then click on the \"Environment Variables\"  button. Under \"System variables\", scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Click on \"Edit\", then add the path to the Python executable to the list of paths. For example, if Python is installed in the \"C:\\Python37\" folder, add \"C:\\Python37\" to the path variable.\n",
